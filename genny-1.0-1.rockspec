		Lua defines iterators that can be used with for loops. Unfortunately,
		since they are defined as 3 separate values, it is very hard to
		manipulate these iterators. Genny defines so-called "generators", which
		nothing but lua iterators that don't take any arguments. Since this
		means a generator is a single (callable) value, it's much easier to
		pass them around, manipulate them, store them, etc.
